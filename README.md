# stock-prediction-using-prophet
In this project, I used Facebook Prophet to predict stock values. Facebook Prophet is a robust time series forecasting tool developed by Facebookâ€™s Core Data Science team. It is designed to handle various types of time series data by decomposing it into three main components: trend, seasonality, and holidays.

Trend: Prophet identifies and models the long-term trend in the data, which helps in understanding the overall direction of stock prices.
Seasonality: The model automatically detects and adjusts for seasonal patterns, such as monthly or yearly cycles, which are common in financial data.
Holiday Effects: Prophet can incorporate the impact of significant events or holidays on stock prices, providing a more accurate forecast.
One of the key features of Prophet is its ability to provide uncertainty intervals for its forecasts, which helps in understanding the range within which the actual stock values are likely to fall. This makes it a valuable tool for making informed decisions based on predicted stock trends.
